## 🎨 Tokyo Night Theme (Kitty)

This setup uses a **minimal dark theme with transparency**, based on the **Tokyo Night theme**.

### 🎨 Applying Tokyo Night Theme (Kitty + kitten themes)

Kitty provides built-in themes via `kitten themes`.

Run:

```bash
kitty +kitten themes
```

Then search for:

```
Tokyo Night
```

Select it and apply.

To make it permanent, add this line to your `kitty.conf`:

```conf
include ~/.config/kitty/themes/Tokyo_Night.conf
```

---

### 🧊 Glass Effect (Blur + Transparency) (optional)

Transparency is handled by Kitty, but **blur depends on your desktop environment**.

#### For GNOME:

Install extension:
👉 **Blur My Shell**

Then:

* Enable blur
* Adjust opacity & radius

---

### 🎨 Colors

You can customize colors inside `kitty.conf`:

```conf
background #0f111a
foreground #cdd6f4
cursor #f5e0dc
```
